# iFastr Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Intermittent Fasting tracker designed with both beginners and experienced users in mind. Through experimentation a user can time, track, update and review their fasting analytics. 

```iFastr Client``` is the frontend for ```iFastr```. to see iFastr in action, checkout <a href=''>iFastr</a>.

The ```iFastr``` backend can be found at: <a href=''>iFastr-api</a>.

```iFastr``` supports creating a user profile. Authentication is comming soon.

## Let's Boost Our Metabilism

```iFastr``` is for the health enthusiast. We aim to provide a clean user experience while providing the necessary support to succeed in weigh management. ```iFastr```'s guided user experience allows the user to learn about the fundamentals of intermittent fasting, select a fasting option, and set a daily start time. 

The ```iFastr Client``` will continue to to grow. Plans to integrate diet and workout tracking are on the horizon. Push notifications, dual-authentication and personalized data reports are all in the pipeline.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
